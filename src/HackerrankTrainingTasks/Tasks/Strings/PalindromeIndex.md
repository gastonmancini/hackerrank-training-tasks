PalindromeIndex
-------------------------------------------------------------

Given a string of lowercase letters, determine the index of the character whose removal will make the string a palindrome. If the string is already a palindrome, then print −1−1. There will always be a valid solution.

Input Format

The first line contains TT (the number of test cases). 
The TT subsequent lines of test cases each contain a single string to be checked.

Constraints 
1≤T≤201≤T≤20 
1≤1≤ length of string ≤100005≤100005 
All characters are Latin lower case indexed.

Output Format

Print the zero-indexed position (integer) of a character whose deletion will result in a palindrome; if there is no such character (i.e.: the string is already a palindrome), print -1. Any correct answer will be accepted; e.g.: for a string such as bcbc, we can either remove b at index 00 or c at index 33—both answers are acceptable.

Sample Input

3
aaab
baa
aaa
Sample Output

3
0
-1
Explanation

Test Case 1(aaabaaab): Removing b at index 33 results in a palindrome, so we print 3.

Test Case 2(baabaa): Removing b at index 00 results in a palindrome, so we print 0.

Test Case 3(aaaaaa): This string is already a palindrome, so we print -1; however, 0, 1, and 2 are also all acceptable answers, as the string will still be a palindrome if any one of the characters at those indices are removed.
